ðŸ‘‹ My name is Zihua. I'm a developer with a passion for building tools for developers.

I'm working at [Slab](https://slab.com/), where I focus on WYSIWYG editor frameworks: [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill), [Parchment](https://github.com/quilljs/parchment), and [Delta](https://github.com/quilljs/delta).

Besides that, I contribute to open source projects: [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis), [Medis](https://github.com/luin/medis), and [Readability](https://github.com/luin/readability).
