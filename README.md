## Hey there, I'm Zihua ðŸ‘‹

I'm super passionate about creating tools that make life easier and more fun for developers like you.

Right now, I'm all about WYSIWYG editor frameworks and related distributed data structures. I am primarily maintaining the Quill editor, including [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill), [Parchment](https://github.com/quilljs/parchment), and [Delta](https://github.com/quilljs/delta).

I created [ioredis](https://github.com/redis/ioredis), one of the most popular clients for Redis. It was acquired by Redis Ltd. in 2023.

Besides all that, I also dabble in making macOS and iOS apps. [Medis](https://github.com/luin/medis) is a delightful and popular Redis GUI tool I developed. The first version was developed with Electron and has now been rewritten in Swift.

Feel free to explore my repositories and hit me up if you've got any questions or just want to chat! I'm here for you.
