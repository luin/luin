## Hi there, I'm Zihua ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about creating tools for developers to make their work more enjoyable.

Currently, I am focusing on WYSIWYG editor frameworks and related distributed data structures. I am primarily maintaining the Quill editor, including [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill), [Parchment](https://github.com/quilljs/parchment), and [Delta](https://github.com/quilljs/delta).

I created [ioredis](https://github.com/redis/ioredis), one of the most popular clients for Redis. It has now been adopted by the official Redis team.

In addition to that, I occasionally develop macOS and iOS apps. [Medis](https://github.com/luin/medis) is a delightful and popular Redis GUI tool I developed. The first version was developed with Electron and has now been rewritten in Swift.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions!
